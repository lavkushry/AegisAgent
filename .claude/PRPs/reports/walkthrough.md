# AegisAgent AI Developer Rules, Context & Harness Walkthrough

This walkthrough documents the refined AI developer context files, the new workspace rules files, and the installation/harness script configured in the repository.

---

## Refined Components

### 1. Refined AI Context files
- **[CLAUDE.md](file:///home/ems/AegisAgent/CLAUDE.md):** Added coding standards for **Multi-Tenant Isolation** (binding `tenant_id` on all database operations) and **OpenTelemetry Instrumentation** (using Rust `tracing` and propagating traceparent context). Included context harness commands, standard **API endpoints**, and **reliability SLO targets** from the PRD/Operational design.
- **[AGENTS.md](file:///home/ems/AegisAgent/AGENTS.md):** Aligned scopes to include `/mcp-gateway-lite` and `/policy-templates`. Assigned ownership of tenant partitioning and context trust labeling to active agent roles.
- **skills/ runbooks:**
  - [skills/security_scan.md](file:///home/ems/AegisAgent/skills/security_scan.md): Added Multi-Tenant Data Isolation Audit section (filtering database operations by `tenant_id`) and a comprehensive **Secure Defaults (Fail-Closed) checklist** for validating unknown endpoints, actions, and token callbacks.
  - [skills/cedar_policy_authoring.md](file:///home/ems/AegisAgent/skills/cedar_policy_authoring.md): Added guides and policies for **six specific Context Trust Levels** (`trusted_internal_signed`, `trusted_internal_unsigned`, `semi_trusted_customer`, `untrusted_external`, `malicious_suspected`, `unknown`) and MCP Tool Hashing/Drift Check.
  - [skills/database_migration.md](file:///home/ems/AegisAgent/skills/database_migration.md): Added indexing guidelines for the `tenant_id` column to ensure sub-millisecond query performance.
  - [skills/skill_comply.md](file:///home/ems/AegisAgent/skills/skill_comply.md): Added **Automated Compliance Measurement** runbook to guide agents in self-auditing code changes (CWE checks, formatting, telemetry, task/walkthrough syncing).
  - [skills/rust_standards.md](file:///home/ems/AegisAgent/skills/rust_standards.md): Added Rust standard coding rules (Tokio async time-outs, custom strong error propagation, Serde derivations, clippy checks).
  - [skills/python_standards.md](file:///home/ems/AegisAgent/skills/python_standards.md): Added Python SDK standards (PEP 8, type hints, custom subclasses exceptions, unittest patch mock verifications).
  - [skills/axum_patterns.md](file:///home/ems/AegisAgent/skills/axum_patterns.md): Added Axum API patterns (state injection, request/json extraction, custom IntoResponse application error mappings).
  - [skills/sqlite_usage.md](file:///home/ems/AegisAgent/skills/sqlite_usage.md): Added SQLite SQLx usage guidelines (WAL mode pool tuning, transactions lifecycle scopes, compile-timeChecked queries).
  - [skills/prompt_optimizer.md](file:///home/ems/AegisAgent/skills/prompt_optimizer.md): Added **Prompt & Rule Optimizer** skill to help agents write concise Cedar rules, format payload requests, and keep token context sizes optimized.
  - [skills/project_flow_ops.md](file:///home/ems/AegisAgent/skills/project_flow_ops.md): Added **Project Flow & Release Operations** skill covering local setup baselines, test running pipelines, pre-release offline compilation checks, and Helm lints.

### 2. Created Rules Harness Script (`scripts/setup_agent_harness.sh`)
An automation script (`scripts/setup_agent_harness.sh`) that dynamically configures workspace rules depending on active development requirements (ECC-style selective profile loading).
- **Commands:**
  - `bash scripts/setup_agent_harness.sh --profile <architect|developer|auditor|ops>`: Configures context-targeted rules inside the `.claude/rules/` folder and updates root `.cursorrules`/`.clauderules`.
  - `bash scripts/setup_agent_harness.sh --all`: Installs all pipelines.
  - `bash scripts/setup_agent_harness.sh --clean`: Clears generated rules in `.claude/rules/` and resets root configurations.

### 3. Created Rules Files
- **[.cursorrules](file:///home/ems/AegisAgent/.cursorrules):** Automatically updated by the harness script to prompt developer agents to load relevant active profiles and style guidelines.
- **[.clauderules](file:///home/ems/AegisAgent/.clauderules):** Keeps Claude Code aligned with active profile boundaries.

## Verification Performed
- Made the script executable and ran `bash scripts/setup_agent_harness.sh --all` to pre-initialize the rule assets.
- Ran `git status` to verify all generated folders and configs are correctly structured within the `/home/ems/AegisAgent` workspace.
